# HudsMFP

HudsMFP, or HUDS for MyFitnessPal, is a simple project I created in the fall of 2022 to help myself, and other students at Harvard, take control of and optimize their fitness. 

## About

MyFitnessPal is a web application (and app) that allows individuals to track fitness information such as caloric exertion and intake. Many individuals who want to build muscle, lose weight, or simply stay in shape use these features to track their nutritonal intake, such as myself. 

Harvard University Dining Services (HUDS) is the organization responsible for the feeding of all ~6000 Harvard Undergraduates for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. HUDS has nutritional information available for each of its entrees, sides, drinks, etc. on its website. 

This would be tedious to manually enter or scrape, so I got access to the HUDS API, and wrote this simple program to automatically get the nutritional information from each new food from the following week and enter it into the MyFitnessPal database.

## Results

There are currently 450+ meals that this algorithm has uploaded into MyFitnessPal under the brand name "HUDS mmoorman", to allow fellow students to quickly and easily find the correct foods. I've spread word of this around campus, and have even had 5 or so strangers come up to me at the gym to ask if I was the one who created this program, so it seems to me that the Harvard population is getting at least some good utility out of this.
